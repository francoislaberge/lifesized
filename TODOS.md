### Todos
  - Include this in references:
    - https://github.com/kickingvegas/12pt-should-be-the-same-everywhere/blob/master/absoluteMeasurementDPI.md
  - Add Windows/Linux native support
  - Make sure that the module works in the main process just as well as in a render process.
  - Propose Electron add this to it's core
    - Already did this, but will push again when I have a better example/use-case to really sell it
  - Read these:
    - http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.33.0/api/screen/#screen-getalldisplays
    - http://stackoverflow.com/a/12589799
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3019346/is-there-a-way-to-determine-the-physical-size-of-the-monitor
  - demos
    - coins
    - shaq hands
    - measuring tape
    - giant squid eye? (Is there even such a picture)
    - QR code related? Display it on a screen instead of printing for example. See [ARToolkit](http://www.artoolkit.org/documentation/doku.php?id=2_Configuration:config_camera_calibration), [JS Implementation](https://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit), [html5rocks.com tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webgl/jsartoolkit_webrtc/)
    - Do some video face tracking and face size maintaining. Also see:
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ9Ih-49O3o, via http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/
  - Make downloadable apps for the demos to make it easy for non devs to try it out.
  - Make case for physiological rules based model for responsive designs
    - example, estimate view distance, plus pixel density, plus real world width to determine the ideal column width for easy readibility (font size matters, reducing eye strain mentally scanning back to left to figure out what hte next line is)
  - Make sure of the following:
    - Think about fallbacks when not on macs?
      - Return the usual default of 72?
      - Return something representing unavailable like null?
    - Detect and throw exception when in the incorrect environment:
      - node.js
      - Electron's main process
    - Provide APIs for
      - Getting the DPI
      - Getting the size of a display in inches (function defaults to the current window's 'screen', a screen can be provided to find the correct one)
      - Getting the size of the browser window in inches
      - Ensure there are events to communicate a change ppi
        - Wait, PPI can't change, just the display that the browserwindow is over,
          perhaps instead just documenting that users should use the built-in event for changes to the display
          - hmmmm, seems there is no such event. We'll have to rig it up by figuring it out ourselves. Hopefully we can figure out which window the window is in
