# Lifesized
Get the real size, dpi, user view distance, zoom, pixel ratios, and more of devices in browser.

This project is a work in progress. Currently it's no more than a placeholder of the npm module name,
this readme, and a simple hacked demo.

# Project Philosophy
The size of fonts, line spacing, margins, row widths, button dimensions, and more aspects of design
should be based the physical size of elements on a screen. We'd like to use every trick in the book
to make a best guess at the real world DPIs of devices as well as guesses to other parts of the user
experience environment such as users viewing distance from the screen.

We hope this will provide more precise inputs to responsive designs.

# Installation

      npm install lifesized
